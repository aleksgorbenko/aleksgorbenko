## 👋 Hello there, I am Aleks

Disciplined Software Engineer with a strong focus on organization, process optimization, and team velocity. I bring a cross-functional perspective from my background in luxury hospitality and SEO, combined with well-rounded experience in distributed systems and scalable architecture.

In my last role, I led a fully remote team of 8 engineers across 7 nationalities, managing three finTech products for UK-based banks and financial institutions. These systems were deployed in Kubernetes and designed as distributed microservices architectures.
